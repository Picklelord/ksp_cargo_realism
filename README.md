# KSP Mod Cargo Realism
This mod for Kerbal Space Program aims to make the cargo volume more accurate and allow for better stacking of items in containers.
The majority of items have a stack of 20 items, some smaller items have 50, 100 and even 200 if they are small enough!

I have also added multiple larger containers for bigger missions and the bigger parts that have been adjusted to fit in containers!

NOTE: I have excluded changing the L volumes for the small partial inventory items as its anyones guess as to what they should be.. I may revisit this at a later date.. 

# still needing to be done
  - ADD missing parts! Mostly the utilities and squad expansion parts
  - squadExpansion parts at the end have not been accurately set and need to be adjusted!
 
# known issues

  - I have been finding that some items will not add the stackQuantity variable regardless of what I add, I believe the main limitation is items that contain resources(electricity, fuel, ore)
  - I have had a bug where when shifting stacks from one container to another, the stack duplicates but cannot be placed back in any container and resulted in having to restart ksp, I experienced this in the vanilla game too so it appears to be a bug in game, not this mod.
